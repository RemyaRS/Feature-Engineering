# Feature-Engineering
Comprises All Important Concepts In Feature Engineering

Steps : 
Feature Engineering :
1.	EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis

i.	Check how many numerical features are there – defined on the basis seaborn and matplotlib

ii.	Check how many categorical features are there

iii.	Check number of missing values 

iv.	Check whether there is any outlier using boxplot

v.	Cleaning raw data – extracting many features from one feature


2.	Handling missing values

i.	Using mean, median & mode

ii.	Forward fill, backfill and interpolate
 

3.	Handling imbalanced dataset


4.	Treating the outliers



5.	Scaling the data - Standardization or Normalization used


6.	Converting categorical features into numerical features
